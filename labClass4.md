# Lab 4 Notes

## Forms and Filter

### Feature 1 Filter by Number of Horns

Given that a user is presented with filtering options when the user clicks on one option then the images should be filtered accordingly.

Using the `Form` component of `react-bootstrap` build a drop down menu so that the user can choose to filter by number of horns.
When the user chooses one of the options, the correct images should be displayed.
